## Keybinds

You can make a command executed when you press a key.

Using the 'keybind' command, you can open up the keybind menu to set each key to a command.

Using the 'keybind alt' command, you can open up the alternative keybind menu. To use them, hold Left Alt and make sure the top text appear, then press the key.

## Autocommand

You can make commands automatically executed when you execute the script.

Using the 'autocommand' command, you can open up the autocommand menu to add a command to execute when you start the script up.
